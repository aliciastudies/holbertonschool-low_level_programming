# Learning Objectives
**What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it**

A static library is a collection of precompiled object files.
It is created using the "ar" command and linked with programs during compilation to provide reusable code and functions.


**Basic usage of `ar`, `ranlib`, `nm`**

- **ar** - creates, modifies, and extracts files from static libraries.
- **ranlib** - generates index for static libraries.
- **nm**: lists symbols in object files or static libraries.
