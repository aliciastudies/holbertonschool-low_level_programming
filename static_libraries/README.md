** What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it **

A static library is a collection of precompiled object files. 
It is created using the "ar" command and linked with programs during compilation to provide reusable code and functions.


** Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm **

- **ar**: Create, modify, and extract files from static libraries.
- **ranlib**: Generate index for static libraries.
- **nm**: List symbols in object files or static libraries.
