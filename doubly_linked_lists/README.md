**What is a doubly linked list**

A doubly linked list is a data structure that organises data elements (nodes). Each node contains two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node. The list can be traversed forwards and backwards.

**How to use doubly linked lists**

1. Define a structure for the nodes of the list. It should contain the data to be stored and two pointers for the previous and next nodes.

2. Create functions to perform basic operations on the doubly linked list, such as inserting a new node, deleting a node, searching for a specific value, and printing the list.

3. Implement the functions to interact with the doubly linked list.
