# Learning Objectives

**How to use the exit function**

`exit()` immediately terminates a program. It is usually used when there is a critical error or a certain condition that requires the program to stop running immediately.


**What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them**

They are used for dynamic memory allocation for specific reasons.

- **calloc**: used for an array of elements and initialises all the allocated bytes to zero.

- **realloc**: used to modify (increase or decrease) the size of an already allocated block of memory.
