**What is recursion**

A programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller instances.
It involves a base case to terminate the recursion.


**How to implement recursion**

1. Identify the base case: Determine the condition that will terminate the recursion and prevent further function calls.
This is usually a simple case that can be directly solved without recursion.

2. Define the recursive case: Determine how the problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem.
This involves calling the function recursively with modified parameters.

3. Implement the base case: Write the code that handles the base case.
This is the part of the function that provides the termination condition and returns a value without making any further recursive calls.

4. Implement the recursive case: Write the code that handles the recursive case.
This is the part of the function where the function calls itself with modified parameters and combines the results to solve the original problem.


**In what situations you should implement recursion**

- Solving problems with inherent recursive structure: Recursion is particularly effective when the problem can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem.

- Simplifying complex problems: Recursive solutions can help simplify complex problems by dividing them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

- Implementing recursive data structures: Recursion is commonly used to implement and manipulate recursive data structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs.

- Working with self-referential or hierarchical data: Recursion is useful when dealing with data that has a hierarchical or self-referential nature. It allows you to traverse and process such data structures effectively.


**In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion**

- When efficiency is critical: Each recursive call adds a new stack frame and consumes additional memory.
This can lead to stack overflow errors or slower execution for large input sizes.

- When the problem doesn't have a natural recursive structure: If the problem does not involve dividing it into smaller problems or does not have a clear recursive pattern.

- When the recursion depth is too deep: Recursive functions rely on the system's call stack, which has a limited capacity.
If the recursion depth (i.e., the number of nested function calls) becomes too deep, it can result in a stack overflow error.

- When the code needs to be simple and easy to understand: Recursive solutions can sometimes be more challenging to understand. If code readability and simplicity are important considerations, an iterative approach may be the better choice.
