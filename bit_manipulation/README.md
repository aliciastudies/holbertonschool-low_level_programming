**How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators**

Bitwise operators manipulate individual bits in binary data.  They are helpful for low-level tasks, optimising memory, setting flags, and arithmetic.

**Operators:**
- & (AND) compares each bit and returns 1 if both are 1.
- | (OR) returns 1 if at least one bit is 1.
- ^ (XOR) returns 1 for different bits.
- << (LEFT) and (RIGHT) >> shift bits left or right by a certain number of positions
- ~ (NOT) inverts all bits.

The behaviour of the  operators depends on the size of the data type (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit)
