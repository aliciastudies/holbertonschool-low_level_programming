# Learning Objectives

**How to use arguments passed to your program**

Additional information (arguments) can be passed in the command line to the program running.


**What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other**

- **argc**: "argument count" represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program. It is an integer value.

- **argv**: "argument vector" is an array of pointers to characters. It holds the actual command-line arguments as individual strings, where each string represents one argument.


**How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters**

They can be used to prevent compiler warnings about unused variables or parameters.
