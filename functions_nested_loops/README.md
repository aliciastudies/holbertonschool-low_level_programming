# Learning Objectives

- **What are nested loops and how to use them**

They are loops within loops and allow repeated execution of code blocks in an ordered way. 


- **What is a function and how do you use functions**

A block of code that performs a specific task and is used by calling its name with appropriate arguments.

- **What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function**

A function declaration tells the compiler about the existence and signature of a function, while a definition provides the actual implementation of the function.


- **What is a prototype**

It specifies the function's name, return type, and parameter types without providing the implementation.

- **Scope of variables**

Refers to the region of the program where the variable is accessible and can be referenced.

- **What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89**

They enable comprehensive warning messages (-Wall and -Wextra), treat warnings as errors (-Werror), and enforce strict adherence to the C language standard (-pedantic with -std=gnu89).enable comprehensive warning messages (-Wall and -Wextra), treat warnings as errors (-Werror), and enforce strict adherence to the C language standard (-pedantic with -std=gnu89).


- **What are header files and how to to use them with #include**

They contain function prototypes, definitions, and declarations, and are included in C programs using the `#include` directive to provide access to their contents.
