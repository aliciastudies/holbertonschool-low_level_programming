## What is a search algorithm

A search algorithm is a step-by-step process where it is looking for a specific piece of information, usually within a collection of data. These algorithms are used to locate items, values, or records in various data structures like lists, arrays, or databases.

## What is a linear search
A linear search checks each item in a list or array one by one, from the beginning to the end, until it finds the target item or determines that the item is absent.

## What is a binary search
Binary search is used on sorted data. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, eliminating half of the remaining items in each step until the target item is found or determined to be absent.

## What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

- **Linear Search** - when the data is not sorted or when you need to find the first occurrence of an item in an unsorted list. It's simple but may not be efficient for large datasets.

- **Binary Search** - only when the data is sorted. It's much faster than linear search for large datasets.
